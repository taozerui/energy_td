The code is basically builded on `PyTorch`.
Detailed requirements are listed in `./requirements.txt`.

We provide several examples.

1. Simulation for mixture of Gaussian distribution: `./simulation_mog.ipynb`
2. Simulation for dynamic tensor completion: `./simulation_dynamic.ipynb`
3. Experiment for *Beijing Air* dataset: `./exp_beijing_air.py`
